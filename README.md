# Multi-Sensor-Active-Tracking-System

MSATS — Multi-Sensor Active Tracking System

A vision-guided classification and response system that detects colored geometric targets using OpenCV and executes different actions via Arduino-controlled actuators.
The system performs real-time object segmentation, contour analysis, and shape recognition to distinguish civilians from hostile targets and applies rule-based decision logic.

Includes:

Computer vision pipeline (HSV masking, contour filtering, shape classification)

Real-time tracking and coordinate extraction

Decision engine (armed / unarmed / ignore)

Hardware control interface for servo-based actuation

Demo datasets, calibration tests, and failure cases
